Hi, I’m **Alex Koyoc**.

I’m a UCLA linguistics student interested in **formal syntax, bilingualism, and heritage speakers**.  
This site is where I keep my research projects, notes/handouts, and materials for grad school.

## Research interests
- Formal syntax (movement, agreement, locality)
- Heritage language acquisition and bilingual processing
- Spanish heritage grammar (TAM, pronouns, cue use)

## Current projects
- **LING 197:** Looking at A movement and A Bar movement in Dinka
- **LING 198A:** looking at pronoun distribution in Hertiage Spanish Speakers

## Materials
- **CV:** /files/CV.pdf
