Hi, I’m **Alex Koyoc**.

I’m a UCLA linguistics student interested in **formal syntax, bilingualism, and heritage speakers**.  
This site is where I keep my research projects, notes/handouts, and materials for grad school.

## Research interests
- Formal syntax (movement, agreement, locality)
- Heritage language acquisition and bilingual processing
- Spanish heritage grammar (TAM, pronouns, cue use)

## Current projects
- **Project A:** (1–2 lines on what you’re working on)
- **Project B:** (1–2 lines)

## Materials
- **CV:** /files/CV.pdf
- **Handouts & notes:** (link these once you add pages)
- **Contact:** (email or a contact page)
